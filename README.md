# npdrm_free
by qwikrazor87

A PSP/ePSP plugin to run official NPDRM PS1/PSP content without need of a valid .rif license or act.dat.

## Usage
- Place npdrm_free.prx at ms0:/seplugins/npdrm_free.prx.
- Enable plugin in both ms0:/seplugins/game.txt and ms0:/seplugins/vsh.txt.
- Write this line in both .txt files:
  - PSP 1000/2000/3000/E1000 : `ms0:/seplugins/npdrm_free.prx 1`
  - PSP N1000 (PSP Go) : `ef0:/seplugins/npdrm_free.prx 1`
- Restart VSH, now you can run any official PSN content without a license.

ALL content MUST be encrypted and left as is from official .pkg for this plugin to work, otherwise use NoDRM engine in PRO CFW.

## Changelog
### v7.2
- Suspend/resume issue should be fixed, thanks to kyleatlast.
### v7.1
- Fixed the import scanning function that caused a crash on false positives.
### v7.0
- This plugin now patches the core of npdrm to decrypt content if and only if the official method (rif + act.dat) fails
- Now you can run official PSN games and DLC without needing to decrypt them.
- Now generates KEYS.BIN for official PSN PS1 EBOOTs on-the-fly if needed.
- PSN TG-16/PC Engine games can now be run without first decrypting any content, do NOT decrypt the PSP-KEY.EDAT for it.
- PTF themes requiring a license can now be installed.
- Suspend issue from previous versions should now be fixed, if not try disabling all other plugins.

## Credits
Huge thanks to all involved in the PSP/ePSP/PSVita homebrew community, devs and users alike,
without whom I would not be able to accomplish this task. You are too numerous to name.

Big thanks to kyleatlast who revived this project by finally fixing the suspend issue in ePSP.

I hope you enjoy this plugin as much as I did making it and figuring out how PSP NPDRM works. :)
